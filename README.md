# The Mystery of the Missing Profits

# Sales Detective 
## 📋 Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a fictional retail company to uncover trends, identify anomalies, and create an interactive dashboard using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to:
1. Clean and analyze sales data using Python.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.
3. Use SQL queries to extract insights.
4. Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the findings.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying the dataset.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards.
- **Google Colab**: For running Python and SQL code.

## 📂 Files
- `Sample - Superstore.csv`: The original dataset.
- `cleaned_superstore.csv`: The cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- `PROJECT_1.ipynb`: Python code for data cleaning, EDA, and SQL queries.
- `profit project 1.pbix`: Power BI dashboard for visualization.

---

## 🚀 Steps to Reproduce
1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Download the [Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) from Kaggle.

2. **Run the Python Code**:
   - Open `sales_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab.
   - Upload the `superstore.csv` file to Colab.
   - Run the code to clean the data, perform EDA, and run SQL queries.

3. **Visualize in Power BI**:
   - Download the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_superstore.csv`) from Colab.
   - Open `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
   - Import the cleaned dataset and explore the interactive dashboard.
